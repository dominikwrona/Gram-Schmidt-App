Bug 0.01
- fix the new java version problems
Status: fixed, it was actually bug on their side that bc I raised it is now fixed

User Story 1
Status: Done (some tests might still need to be conducted)
- check if the provided vectors are independent
estimate: 1 hr
actual: 7,8 hrs?

User Story 1.5 Independence for Square matrices
- done: accomplished through recursive cofactor expansion (checking if det != 0)
actual: i dunno like 2 hrs?


User Story 2
Status: Not started
- create a working gram schmidt calculation for R2
estimate: 1-2 hrs

User Story 3
- create a GUI for the app
Status: In Progress
estimate: 3 hours

Add:
- To do: make main step recursive
- make sure user knows limitations: ex. only works on integers, max vector quantity 99
- handle Error cases: different vector sizes (i.e. (1,2), (1,2,3,4))
					  dim or textfield (or both) is empty when submit button is pressed
					  a non-integer is entered into the dim field or vectors are in improper format
					  Error: if there is a 1 that is not leading, final recursive will find it by mistake
					  Dimension field is wrong (ex. dim 3 but vectors are only dim 2) (see if we even need dim, just take matrix.get(0).size)
					  floating point multiplication problems ??
					  - better to use doubles (64 bit) vs floats :( - simple find & replace should be enough
					  
					  problem (e.g. in readme) - the difficulty of getting java to pass Arraylists by value (they like other objects always
					   end up getting passed by reference), with impacts on the runtime as well
